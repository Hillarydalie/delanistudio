Story: Find your Akan name

As a person interested in knowing your Akan name
In order to do so
I want you to select your day of birth.
This date result will be run in our functions to get the century and year.
Then this will enable us calculate and find which day of the week one was born.
And from this result our function will be able to deliver your Akan name.

Scenario 1: The date is selected from the calender well
Given that a date is selected, 
Then we can proceed to select the gender.
When they are both selected then we can click the submit button.
Then your Akan name can be displayed with a pop up of the name.

Scenario 2: The date is not selected from the calender.
Given that a date is selected, 
Then we cannot proceed to select the gender.
Since the submit button will disable if not selected.
And the function will return an undefined prompt.
Then one should go back to the date and begin afresh.
